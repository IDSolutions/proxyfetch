Acts as a proxy for MRGE_2 application to send api calls and decide which cdr records to send back. Will also serve as a command executable system.
All actions done are outgoing and no incoming port is required for this script to function.

This script is most probably not function by its own and not useful for most projects as it is written to act along with an internal application we use. But feel free to grab any part of this application to use with your own project.
